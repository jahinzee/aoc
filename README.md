My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), written in Python.

~~Solutions will not be published before the global leaderboard gold cap has been reached.~~

## Usage

Run each solution with Python - no external modules or packages required. Inputs
can be passed in by file argument or `stdin`.

```sh
$ python 2025/1.py input.txt
# or
$ cat input.txt | python 2025/1.py
```

Output for all code will be in part order. Input files are not provided in this repo.
